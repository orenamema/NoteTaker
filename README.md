# NoteTaker

## Introduction

I have created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes.This application is great for users that have a hard time remembering notes, it helps them take notes, store and delete them at their leisure. This application uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

It includes the following HTML routes:

* GET /notes - Should return the notes.html file.
* GET * - Should return the index.html file

The application has a JSON file using the fs module.

I have also used the following API routes:

* GET /api/notes 
* POST /api/notes
* DELETE /api/notes/:id
